The API design should be simple and easy to understand

By avoiding unnecessary complexity and layers of abstraction we can create a more maintainable API that minimizes confusion and encourages correct usage by API consumers.

The API design aims for the best possible orthogonality, meaning tha the minimum set of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways to build the control and data structures of the API. The more orthogonal the design, the fewer exceptions.
