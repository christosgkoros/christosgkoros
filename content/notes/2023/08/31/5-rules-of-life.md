1. Always be ready to reinvent yourself. Stay foolish for as long as you can, always in learning mode.

2. Act immediately when you feel inspired. Take advantage of your mood to act, don’t overthink it.

3. Don’t adjust yourself to please others. Be yourself, follow your own rules, live with the consequences.

4. Be minimal about the things you need. Don’t overspend on things you don’t really need, live a frugal life.

5. Own your life. Don’t be a slave to a wage, be a master of your time and your life.
