'Who' questions to ask when leading change:

The included: Who else could be or needs to be included in what I’m doing?

The informants: Who has done things like this in the past that I can lean on for support?

The advisors: who could I get advice from or interview to get more insight?

The creatives: Who comes from a different field of work, and could add a creative angle to my change?

The resistors: Who will be most resistant to the change?
